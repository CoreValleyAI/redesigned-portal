# Keycloak Authentication — Implementation Guide

Real OIDC authentication for the CoreValley console, built on **Keycloak 25** and
**NextAuth.js v5 (Auth.js)**.

Keycloak owns identity — login, self-registration, password reset, MFA, brute-force
lockout. The Next.js app never sees a password; it consumes tokens and maps them onto
a `CoreValleyUser`.

## 1. Quick start

Requires Docker and Node 20.9+.

```bash
npm install
npm run keycloak:up          # Keycloak + Postgres, realm imported automatically
cp .env.example .env.local   # already points at the local realm
npm run dev                  # http://localhost:3000
```

Then open <http://localhost:3000>, click **Sign In**, and you land on Keycloak.

| | |
|---|---|
| App | <http://localhost:3000> |
| Keycloak admin console | <http://localhost:8080> — `admin` / `admin` |
| Realm | `corevalley` |
| Client | `corevalley-portal` (confidential) |
| Client secret | `corevalley-portal-dev-secret` |
| Test user (admin) | `kaustuv@corevalley.ai` / `kaustuv123` |
| Test user (member) | `beta@corevalley.ai` / `beta123` |

`AUTH_SECRET` in `.env.example` is a placeholder. Generate a real one:

```bash
npx auth secret          # or: openssl rand -base64 32
```

> **Do not run `npm run build` while `npm run dev` is running.** Both write to
> `.next`. If you see `ENOENT: … .next/server/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.js`,
> that is what happened — `rm -rf .next` and restart.

To skip Docker entirely, comment out `KEYCLOAK_ISSUER` in `.env.local` and add
`AUTH_ALLOW_MOCK=true`. That selects [mock mode](#3-the-three-modes). Keep
`AUTH_SECRET` set — it is required in every mode. Simply deleting `.env.local`
no longer works: with nothing configured the server refuses to start rather
than falling back to a mode that authenticates everyone.

---

## 2. How it works

Standard OIDC authorization-code flow with PKCE. NextAuth is the OIDC *client*;
Keycloak is the *provider*.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor U as User
    participant B as Browser
    participant N as Next.js
    participant K as Keycloak

    U->>B: visit /portal
    B->>N: GET /portal
    N->>N: middleware.ts — no session
    N-->>B: 302 /?signin=1&callbackUrl=/portal
    B->>B: site-header opens AuthModal
    U->>B: click "Continue with SSO"
    B->>N: POST /api/auth/signin/keycloak
    N-->>B: 302 to Keycloak /auth (+ PKCE challenge)
    B->>K: authorization request
    K-->>U: login form
    U->>K: credentials
    K-->>B: 302 /api/auth/callback/keycloak?code=…
    B->>N: callback with code
    N->>K: POST /token (code + verifier + client secret)
    K-->>N: id_token, access_token, refresh_token
    N->>N: jwt callback — map claims to role/org
    N-->>B: Set-Cookie authjs.session-token; 302 /portal
    B->>N: GET /portal (authenticated)
    N-->>B: console renders with real identity
```

Claims flow through three stages:

```
Keycloak ID token / userinfo        lib/auth.ts jwt()          lib/auth.ts session()
────────────────────────────        ────────────────────       ─────────────────────
sub                             →   token.sub              →   session.user.id
name / preferred_username       →   token.name             →   session.user.name
email                           →   token.email            →   session.user.email
picture                         →   token.picture          →   session.user.image
realm_access.roles              →   token.role             →   session.user.role
org                             →   token.org              →   session.user.org
access_token / refresh_token    →   token.accessToken …    →   session.accessToken
```

---

## 3. The three modes

`lib/auth.ts` picks a mode at import time. **Every mode produces the same
`session.user` shape**, so `middleware.ts`, server components and `useSession()`
never branch on which one is active.

| Mode | Trigger | Providers registered | Sign-in behaviour |
|---|---|---|---|
| **keycloak** | `KEYCLOAK_ISSUER` set | `keycloak`, `keycloak-register` | Real authorization-code flow with PKCE |
| **mock** | `KEYCLOAK_ISSUER` unset **and** `AUTH_ALLOW_MOCK=true` **and** `NODE_ENV !== "production"` | `mock` (Credentials) | Returns `MOCK_USER` with no verification |
| **static demo** | `NEXT_STATIC_EXPORT=true` at build | none (no server exists) | `MOCK_SESSION` is baked into `<SessionProvider>`; the button just navigates |
| **(none)** | anything else | — | `lib/auth.ts` throws at import time; the server does not start |

**Mock mode** exists so the console can be developed with nothing else running. Its
`authorize()` deliberately performs no verification, which is why it is opt-in
rather than a fallback: it must be named with `AUTH_ALLOW_MOCK=true`, and it is
refused outright under `NODE_ENV=production`.

A missing `KEYCLOAK_ISSUER` is therefore a startup error, not a silent downgrade.
Before that guard existed, a server deployment that lost its issuer variable — a
typo, an unpropagated secret, a preview environment with no secrets — kept serving
happily and handed an admin session to anyone who clicked Sign In. Failing to boot
is the loud version of the same condition. `AUTH_SECRET` is required in every mode
for the same reason: the previous committed fallback was a published key, and
anyone holding it could mint a session cookie for any deployment still using it.

The static export is exempt from both guards. It has no server, no route handler,
no middleware and no session cookie, so there is nothing for them to protect; it
imports `lib/auth.ts` only for `MOCK_SESSION` and the mode flags, and registers no
providers at all.

**Static demo** is the GitHub Pages build. There is no server, so no session can be
fetched; a `Session` object is passed to `<SessionProvider session={…}>`, which
suppresses the initial `/api/auth/session` fetch that would otherwise 404 and leave
every `useSession()` hanging in `loading`.

## 4. File reference

### New files

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `docker-compose.yml` | Keycloak 25 + Postgres 16, `start-dev --import-realm` |
| `keycloak/corevalley-realm.json` | Realm, client, protocol mappers, roles, user profile, seeded users |
| `lib/auth.ts` | Provider selection, claim mapping, token refresh, federated logout |
| `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.node.ts` | The Auth.js request handler |
| `middleware.ts` | Gates `/portal/*` |
| `components/layout/auth-provider.tsx` | `<SessionProvider>` + auth-mode React context |
| `types/next-auth.d.ts` | Module augmentation adding `role` / `org` |
| `.env.example` | Documented environment template |

### Modified files

| Path | Change |
|---|---|
| `app/layout.tsx` | Wraps the tree in `<AuthProvider>`, passing the server-resolved mode |
| `components/layout/auth-modal.tsx` | Collects no credentials; hands off to the IdP |
| `components/layout/site-header.tsx` | Auto-opens the modal on redirect; shows **Console** when signed in |
| `components/layout/portal-shell.tsx` | Real avatar / name / org, plus a sign-out button |
| `next.config.ts` | Conditional `output: "export"`, `pageExtensions`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_STATIC_DEMO` |
| `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` | Sets `NEXT_STATIC_EXPORT=true` for the Pages build |
| `package.json` | `keycloak:up` / `:down` / `:reset` / `:logs` scripts |

### `lib/auth.ts` exports

| Export | Type | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `handlers` | `{ GET, POST }` | Re-exported by the route handler |
| `auth` | function | Server-side session access, and the middleware wrapper |
| `signIn` / `signOut` | function | Server-side (import from `next-auth/react` in client components) |
| `isKeycloakEnabled` | `boolean` | Mode flag — server only |
| `AUTH_PROVIDER_ID` | `string` | Provider id for sign-in (`keycloak` or `mock`) |
| `AUTH_REGISTER_PROVIDER_ID` | `string` | Provider id for sign-up (`keycloak-register` or `mock`) |
| `KEYCLOAK_ISSUER` | `string` | Resolved issuer URL |
| `MOCK_USER` | object | The canned mock-mode user |
| `MOCK_SESSION` | `Session` | `MOCK_USER` shaped as a session, for the static export |
| `authConfig` | `NextAuthConfig` | The raw config, exported for testing |

**Reading the session server-side:**

```ts
import { auth } from "@/lib/auth";

export default async function Page() {
  const session = await auth();
  if (session?.user.role !== "admin") return <Forbidden />;
  return <AdminPanel org={session.user.org} />;
}
```

---

## 5. Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `KEYCLOAK_ISSUER` | to enable Keycloak | — | **Must include the realm**: `http://localhost:8080/realms/corevalley`. Its presence is what selects Keycloak mode. |
| `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID` | no | `corevalley-portal` | |
| `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET` | in Keycloak mode | `""` | Client is confidential; a wrong value fails at the token exchange, not at redirect |
| `AUTH_ALLOW_MOCK` | to enable mock mode | unset | `true` opts into the no-verification Credentials provider. Ignored (and refused) under `NODE_ENV=production` |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | **always**, for every server build | — none | Signs and encrypts the session JWT. No fallback: a default in a public repo is a key everyone already has |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | no | inferred | Set when the inferred origin is wrong (proxies, tunnels) |
| `NEXT_STATIC_EXPORT` | no | unset | `true` builds the static Pages bundle |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` | no | `""` | Subpath deployments |

The Auth.js conventional names are accepted as fallbacks: `AUTH_KEYCLOAK_ISSUER`,
`AUTH_KEYCLOAK_ID`, `AUTH_KEYCLOAK_SECRET`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`.

`.env.local` is gitignored (`.env*.local`). `.env.example` is committed.

> There is deliberately **no `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_MODE`**. The mode is derived once on
> the server from `KEYCLOAK_ISSUER` and passed to the client as a prop. Two
> variables meaning the same thing eventually disagree.

---

## 6. The Keycloak realm

`keycloak/corevalley-realm.json` is mounted at `/opt/keycloak/data/import` and
imported by `start-dev --import-realm`, using strategy `IGNORE_EXISTING` — it is
imported once, then the database is authoritative. Edits to the JSON require
`npm run keycloak:reset`.

### Realm settings

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `registrationAllowed` | `true` | Self-service sign-up for beta testers |
| `registrationEmailAsUsername` | `true` | One identifier, not two |
| `resetPasswordAllowed` | `true` | "Forgot password" without an admin |
| `loginWithEmailAllowed` | `true` | |
| `bruteForceProtected` | `true` | Lockout after repeated failures |
| `sslRequired` | `none` | **Development only** — see the production checklist |
| `accessTokenLifespan` | 900s (15 min) | Short-lived; refreshed silently |
| `ssoSessionIdleTimeout` | 1800s | |

### Client `corevalley-portal`

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Access type | confidential (`publicClient: false`) |
| Standard flow | enabled (authorization code) |
| Direct access grants | enabled — used by the verification script, not by the app |
| PKCE | `S256` enforced |
| Redirect URIs | `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/keycloak`, `http://localhost:3000/*` |
| Web origins | `http://localhost:3000` |
| Post-logout redirect URIs | `http://localhost:3000/*` |

The wildcard covers `/api/auth/callback/keycloak-register` as well. In production,
list both callbacks explicitly and drop the wildcard.

### Protocol mappers

Two custom mappers on the client. Both set `id.token.claim`, `access.token.claim`
**and** `userinfo.token.claim` — Auth.js reads the OIDC profile from the ID token
merged with userinfo, so a mapper that only targets the access token is invisible
to the app.

| Mapper | Type | Claim | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `realm roles` | `oidc-usermodel-realm-role-mapper` | `realm_access.roles` (multivalued) | Realm role assignments |
| `organisation` | `oidc-usermodel-attribute-mapper` | `org` | The `org` user attribute |

### Roles

| Role | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `admin` | Full control of the organisation's console |
| `member` | Standard access |

`member` is a composite of `default-roles-corevalley`, so **self-registered users
receive it automatically**. The app is defensive regardless: `roleFromProfile()`
returns `admin` only when `admin` is present in `realm_access.roles`, and `member`
in every other case — including a missing or malformed claim.

### User profile

Keycloak 24+ enables the *declarative user profile*, which rejects attributes it
does not know about. The realm therefore declares `org` explicitly, with
`permissions.edit` limited to `admin`: users can see their organisation but not
set or change it, so it does not appear on the registration form and is read-only
in Account Console. `unmanagedAttributePolicy` is `ADMIN_EDIT` for the same
reason — custom attributes can still be added, but only by an administrator.

This matters because `org` is the console's only tenant identifier. Today it is
just a label in the sidebar, but it is the obvious key to scope data, billing and
membership by. Were it user-writable — and with open self-registration it would
be, on an unverified email — anyone could sign up and type `CoreValley` into the
field, and every future check against `session.user.org` would be reading a string
its own subject chose. Assigning it administratively keeps that door shut.

> Editing this file does not change a realm that has already been imported —
> the import strategy is `IGNORE_EXISTING`. Run `npm run keycloak:reset` to
> rebuild the realm from the JSON, or change the attribute permissions under
> *Realm settings → User profile* in the admin console.

### Seeded users

| Username / email | Password | Realm roles | `org` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `kaustuv@corevalley.ai` | `kaustuv123` | `admin`, `member` | `CoreValley` |
| `beta@corevalley.ai` | `beta123` | `member` | `Himal Analytics` |

---

## 7. Session shape and types

`types/next-auth.d.ts` augments the `next-auth` and `next-auth/jwt` modules. Without
it, `session.user.role` is a type error everywhere.

```ts
session = {
  user: {
    id: string;                    // Keycloak `sub` (a UUID)
    name: string | null;
    email: string;
    image: string | null;
    role: "admin" | "member";
    org: string | null;
  },
  accessToken?: string;            // Keycloak mode only
  error?: "RefreshAccessTokenError";
  expires: string;
}
```

### Claim mapping rules

**`role`** — `admin` if `realm_access.roles` contains `admin`, otherwise `member`.
Fails closed.

**`org`** — the `org` claim (string or first element if multivalued). If absent,
falls back to the **email domain**, so users created before the mapper existed still
resolve to something meaningful. `null` only if there is no email either.

Session strategy is **JWT**, not database. That keeps `middleware.ts` on the Edge
runtime with no per-request database round trip. Session lifetime is 8 hours.

---

## 8. Route protection

`middleware.ts` wraps `auth()` and guards `/portal/:path*`:

```ts
export default auth((req) => {
  if (req.auth) return;
  const { pathname, search, origin } = req.nextUrl;
  const signInUrl = new URL("/", origin);
  signInUrl.searchParams.set("signin", "1");
  signInUrl.searchParams.set("callbackUrl", `${pathname}${search}`);
  return Response.redirect(signInUrl);
});

export const config = { matcher: ["/portal/:path*"] };
```

Design notes:

- **The matcher lists `/portal` explicitly** rather than using a negated catch-all.
  Marketing routes, `/api/auth/*` and static assets never enter the middleware at
  all, so there is no chance of the auth handler gating itself.
- **`?signin=1`** tells `site-header.tsx` to open the modal, so a redirected user
  gets an explanation rather than a blank home page.
- **`callbackUrl` is a relative path here** and is absolutised in the modal — see
  [§15](#15-design-decisions).
- Auth.js's `authorized` callback exists in the config but the middleware does its
  own check, because `authorized` cannot construct a `callbackUrl` pointing at the
  originally requested page.

Adding another protected area is a one-line change:

```ts
matcher: ["/portal/:path*", "/admin/:path*"]
```

---

## 9. UI integration

### `components/layout/auth-provider.tsx`

A client component holding `<SessionProvider>` plus an `AuthModeContext`. The mode
travels from server to client as props, not environment variables:

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx (server component)
<AuthProvider
  keycloak={isKeycloakEnabled}
  staticDemo={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STATIC_DEMO === "true"}
  providerId={AUTH_PROVIDER_ID}
  registerProviderId={AUTH_REGISTER_PROVIDER_ID}
  demoSession={MOCK_SESSION}
>
```

Consume it with `useAuthMode()`.

### `components/layout/auth-modal.tsx`

**Collects no credentials.** There is no email field, no password field, no
hardcoded comparison. The single button calls `signIn()`:

| Mode | Button action |
|---|---|
| Sign in | `signIn("keycloak", { callbackUrl })` |
| Sign up | `signIn("keycloak-register", { callbackUrl })` → Keycloak's Register screen |
| Mock | `signIn("mock", { callbackUrl })` |
| Static demo | `router.push(callbackPath)` |

It also renders Auth.js error codes arriving on `/?error=` (`Configuration`,
`AccessDenied`, `OAuthCallbackError`, …) as readable messages, and shows a footer
line naming the active mode so nobody mistakes mock for real.

### `components/layout/site-header.tsx`

Opens the modal when the URL carries `?signin=1` or `?error=`, and replaces the
Sign In / Sign Up pair with a **Console** link once `status === "authenticated"`.

### `components/layout/portal-shell.tsx`

The sidebar footer shows the real identity: Keycloak profile picture when the realm
supplies one, two-letter initials otherwise; display name; organisation; and a
sign-out button calling `signOut({ callbackUrl: "/" })`. The topbar avatar links to
settings and carries the email as its tooltip.

---

## 10. Token lifecycle

### Refresh

Keycloak access tokens live 15 minutes; the app session lives 8 hours. The `jwt`
callback refreshes 30 seconds before expiry:

```
token.expiresAt reached?  →  POST {issuer}/protocol/openid-connect/token
                             grant_type=refresh_token
                          →  success: new access/id/refresh token + expiresAt
                          →  failure: token.error = "RefreshAccessTokenError"
```

`session.error` surfaces the failure so a client can force re-authentication:

```tsx
const { data: session } = useSession();
if (session?.error === "RefreshAccessTokenError") signIn("keycloak");
```

### Federated logout

`signOut()` alone clears only the app's cookie. The Keycloak SSO cookie would
survive, and the next sign-in would complete silently with no prompt — which looks
exactly like sign-out being broken.

The `signOut` **event** therefore calls Keycloak's end-session endpoint with the
stored `id_token_hint`. Failures are swallowed: a back-channel problem must not
block the local sign-out.

---

## 11. Static export interaction

The marketing site deploys to GitHub Pages as a static export. `output: "export"`
cannot host a dynamic route handler:

```
Error: export const dynamic = "force-static"/export const revalidate not configured
on route "/api/auth/[...nextauth]" with "output: export"
```

The fix is to make the file invisible to that build:

```ts
// next.config.ts
const staticExport = process.env.NEXT_STATIC_EXPORT === "true";

...(staticExport ? { output: "export" as const } : {}),

pageExtensions: staticExport
  ? ["tsx", "ts", "jsx", "js"]
  : ["node.ts", "tsx", "ts", "jsx", "js"],
```

The handler is named **`route.node.ts`**. Next.js only treats a file as a route when
its extension is in `pageExtensions`; `node.ts` is listed for server builds only. In
the static build the file is not a route, and `route.node.ts` does not match plain
`ts` either (the route name would be `route.node`). No stub handler, no conditional
`export const dynamic`, no duplicated source.

| | Server build (default) | Static build (`NEXT_STATIC_EXPORT=true`) |
|---|---|---|
| Output | `.next` | `out/` |
| `/api/auth/*` | present, dynamic | absent |
| Middleware | enforced | not executed |
| Auth | Keycloak or mock | baked-in demo session |
| Used by | `npm run dev`, hosted deploys | `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` |

---

## 12. Operations runbook

### Container lifecycle

```bash
npm run keycloak:up      # start; imports the realm on first run
npm run keycloak:logs    # tail Keycloak
npm run keycloak:down    # stop, keep data
npm run keycloak:reset   # destroy the volume and re-import the realm
```

Health: Postgres uses `pg_isready`; Keycloak is probed over bash `/dev/tcp` against
the **management port 9000**. Keycloak 25 does not serve `/health/ready` on 8080 —
it 404s there.

### Admin tasks

All at <http://localhost:8080> → realm **corevalley**.

| Task | Where |
|---|---|
| Add a user | Users → Add user → Credentials tab → Role mapping tab |
| Grant admin | Users → *user* → Role mapping → Assign `admin` |
| Set organisation | Users → *user* → Attributes → `org` |
| Require MFA | Authentication → Required actions → Configure OTP |
| Enable email (reset links) | Realm settings → Email |
| Change the client secret | Clients → `corevalley-portal` → Credentials |

Changes made in the console live in Postgres, not in the JSON. To make one
permanent, either export the realm over the console and replace
`keycloak/corevalley-realm.json`, or edit the JSON and `npm run keycloak:reset`.

### Adding a role the app understands

1. Realm roles → Create role.
2. Assign it to users.
3. Extend `CoreValleyRole` in `types/next-auth.d.ts`.
4. Extend `roleFromProfile()` in `lib/auth.ts`.

The mapper needs no change — it already forwards every realm role.

---

## 13. Verification

Everything below was executed against the running stack.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Realm imported | `Realm 'corevalley' imported` in the container log |
| Discovery document | `200` at `/realms/corevalley/.well-known/openid-configuration` |
| ID token claims | `realm_access.roles: [… admin …]`, `org: "CoreValley"` |
| Userinfo claims | same `realm_access` and `org` |
| `/portal` unauthenticated | `302 → /?signin=1&callbackUrl=%2Fportal` |
| Providers (Keycloak mode) | `keycloak`, `keycloak-register` |
| Sign-in redirect | Keycloak `/auth` with `code_challenge_method=S256` |
| Sign-up redirect | Keycloak `/registrations` with PKCE |
| Registration form | renders with `email`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `password`, `org` |
| Full code flow | login form → callback → session → `/portal` `200` |
| Session contents | `role=admin`, `org=CoreValley`, Keycloak `sub` as id |
| `callbackUrl` honoured | lands on `/portal/pods`, not `/` |
| Sign-out | session `null`, `/portal` re-gated |
| Federated logout | re-authorize renders the login form (SSO session gone) |
| Mock mode | only `mock` registered; identical session shape; `/portal` `200` |
| Health checks | `keycloak` and `postgres` both `healthy` |
| `npm run lint` | clean |
| Server build | passes — `/api/auth/[...nextauth]` dynamic, middleware 88 kB |
| Static build | passes — no `/api` in `out/` |

### Re-running the end-to-end flow

Drives the complete authorization-code flow from the shell, no browser required:

```bash
CSRF=$(curl -s -c app.txt http://localhost:3000/api/auth/csrf \
  | node -pe "JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync(0)).csrfToken")

KCURL=$(curl -s -b app.txt -c app.txt -o /dev/null -w '%{redirect_url}' \
  -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/signin/keycloak \
  -d "csrfToken=$CSRF" -d 'callbackUrl=http://localhost:3000/portal/pods')

curl -s -c kc.txt "$KCURL" -o login.html
ACTION=$(node -pe "require('fs').readFileSync('login.html','utf8').match(/id=\"kc-form-login\"[^>]*action=\"([^\"]+)\"/)[1].replace(/&amp;/g,'&')")

CB=$(curl -s -b kc.txt -c kc.txt -o /dev/null -w '%{redirect_url}' -X POST "$ACTION" \
  --data-urlencode 'username=kaustuv@corevalley.ai' \
  --data-urlencode 'password=kaustuv123')

curl -s -b app.txt -c app.txt -o /dev/null -w 'lands on: %{redirect_url}\n' "$CB"
curl -s -b app.txt http://localhost:3000/api/auth/session
```

Expected: `lands on: http://localhost:3000/portal/pods`, then a session JSON with
`"role":"admin"` and `"org":"CoreValley"`.

Note the **absolute** `callbackUrl` — see the next section.

---

## 14. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Sign-in always lands on `/` | Relative `callbackUrl` — Auth.js's signin endpoint silently discards it and sets no `authjs.callback-url` cookie | Pass an absolute URL. The modal does this already; replicate it in any new caller |
| `ENOENT … .next/server/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.js` | Static-export `.next` reused by the dev server | `rm -rf .next`, restart |
| `/api/auth/providers` returns the 404 page | Same stale/static `.next`, or `NEXT_STATIC_EXPORT` still set | Unset it, `rm -rf .next` |
| Keycloak container stuck `unhealthy` | Probing `/health/ready` on 8080 | Health lives on port 9000 in KC 25 |
| `invalid_request: Missing parameter: code_challenge_method` | Authorization URL built by hand without PKCE | The client requires `S256`; let Auth.js build the URL |
| `error=OAuthCallbackError` | Redirect URI not registered, or wrong client secret | Compare Clients → `corevalley-portal` → Credentials against `.env.local` |
| `error=Configuration` | `KEYCLOAK_ISSUER` unreachable or missing the realm path | Must end `/realms/corevalley` |
| Signed out, but signing back in needs no password | Federated logout failed | Check the `signOut` event; confirm the realm's post-logout redirect URIs |
| `session.user.role` is a type error | `types/next-auth.d.ts` not picked up | It must be inside `include` in `tsconfig.json` |
| `org` is a domain name, not the organisation | The user has no `org` attribute | Set it in Users → Attributes; the fallback is the email domain |
| Realm edits to the JSON have no effect | Import strategy is `IGNORE_EXISTING` | `npm run keycloak:reset` |
| Portal shows "Account" and no name | `useSession()` returned nothing — usually a missing `<AuthProvider>` | It is mounted in `app/layout.tsx` |

## 15. Design decisions

<details>
<summary><b>Relative <code>callbackUrl</code> is silently dropped by Auth.js</b></summary>

<br>

Posting `callbackUrl=/portal/pods` to `/api/auth/signin/keycloak` sets **no**
`authjs.callback-url` cookie, so the callback falls back to the site root — every
sign-in landed on `/`. Posting `callbackUrl=http://localhost:3000/portal/pods` sets
it correctly.

The modal therefore absolutises before calling `signIn()`:

```ts
callbackUrl: new URL(callbackPath, window.location.origin).href
```

Because `?callbackUrl=` is attacker-controllable, `safePath()` first rejects
anything that is not a same-site path — notably `//evil.com`, which is a
protocol-relative URL, not a path.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Registration needs its own provider entry</b></summary>

<br>

Keycloak serves registration from `/protocol/openid-connect/registrations`, a
*sibling* of the authorization endpoint — not a parameter on it. (`kc_action` is
for required actions like `UPDATE_PASSWORD`; there is no `kc_action=register`.)

So `keycloak-register` is a second `Keycloak()` entry overriding only
`authorization.url`. OIDC discovery still supplies the token, userinfo and JWKS
endpoints, and the client, realm and callback handling are shared. Only the first
screen the user sees differs.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why mock mode is a Credentials provider</b></summary>

<br>

The earlier approach — an empty `providers: []` with a JWT populated in the `jwt`
callback — cannot work. With no provider there is no sign-in, so no token cookie is
ever issued, so `auth()` returns `null` forever and `/portal` is permanently locked.
The `jwt` callback only runs during sign-in or session refresh; it cannot conjure a
session from nothing.

A Credentials provider gives mock mode a real sign-in that mints a real cookie, so
the two modes exercise identical code paths.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>One mode flag, derived on the server</b></summary>

<br>

`KEYCLOAK_ISSUER` is server-only, so client components cannot read it. The obvious
workaround is a parallel `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_MODE`, which then has to be kept in sync
by hand and eventually disagrees — producing a UI that offers SSO while the server
has only the mock provider.

Instead the root layout (a server component) reads `isKeycloakEnabled` once and
passes it down through `AuthProvider`. One source of truth, no duplicated variable.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Mappers target the ID token and userinfo, not just the access token</b></summary>

<br>

Auth.js builds its OIDC `profile` from the ID token merged with the userinfo
response. A protocol mapper configured only with `access.token.claim` is invisible
to the app, and `role` silently degrades to `member` for everyone. Both custom
mappers set all three claim targets.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>JWT sessions, not database sessions</b></summary>

<br>

Middleware runs on the Edge runtime. A database session strategy would need an
adapter and a query on every request into `/portal`. JWT sessions keep the check
local to the request; the cost is that revoking a session before its 8-hour expiry
requires the Keycloak side (which federated logout handles).
</details>

## 16. Production checklist

Everything below is development-grade and **must** change before this faces real
users.

- [ ] **Secrets** — `corevalley-portal-dev-secret` and `admin`/`admin` are in a
      committed file. Rotate both; inject via a secret manager.
- [ ] **`AUTH_SECRET`** — generate per environment (`npx auth secret`); never reuse.
- [ ] **TLS** — realm `sslRequired` is `none`. Set `external` (or `all`) and serve
      Keycloak over HTTPS.
- [ ] **Run mode** — replace `start-dev` with `start`, and set `KC_HOSTNAME` to the
      real hostname with `KC_HOSTNAME_STRICT=true`.
- [ ] **Redirect URIs** — drop the `http://localhost:3000/*` wildcard; list the two
      callback URLs explicitly.
- [ ] **Postgres** — the compose Postgres is a dev convenience. Use a managed
      instance with backups.
- [ ] **Email** — configure SMTP, then enable `verifyEmail` so password reset and
      verification actually deliver.
- [ ] **MFA** — add OTP as a required action, or a conditional browser flow.
- [ ] **Registration** — `registrationAllowed: true` lets anyone create an account.
      For a closed beta, disable it and invite users, or gate on email domain.
- [ ] **Authorization** — `role` is mapped but not yet enforced beyond
      authentication. Add per-route or per-action checks where `admin` matters.
- [x] **Mock mode** — enforced in code: `lib/auth.ts` throws at import time when
      `KEYCLOAK_ISSUER` is unset, and refuses mock mode outright under
      `NODE_ENV=production`. A misconfigured server fails to boot instead of
      signing everyone in.
- [x] **`org` attribute** — admin-assigned only (`permissions.edit: ["admin"]`,
      `unmanagedAttributePolicy: ADMIN_EDIT`), so a self-registered user cannot
      claim another organisation.
- [ ] **Session revocation** — a failed refresh now ends the app session
      (`middleware.ts` rejects it, the console signs itself out). The JWT strategy
      still means revocation is observed at the next refresh, not instantly; if
      that window matters, shorten `session.maxAge` or move to database sessions.
